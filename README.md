# Progressive Mobile UI Kit

The Progressive Mobile UI Kit is a great starting point for the design of any of our projects. It is a Sketch file that contains the base versions of all our components and best practices.

_Documentation is still being fleshed out!_

## Getting Started

To start using the kits, just download it! Make sure the base fonts are installed, or Sketch will have an conniption.

*Before you begin, you should haveâ€¦*
- The _latest version_ of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) installed. Both are included in the kit repo.
