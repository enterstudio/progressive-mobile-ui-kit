# Progressive Mobile UI Kits

The **Progressive Mobile UI Kits** are Sketch files that contain base versions of all our components and best practices. It's a great starting point for beginning the design phase of any of our projects.

- **Fast**
-- Many of our tools--including Sketch itself--do not play well with large files. That is why we've made an effort to split out the UI Kit into several files, to reduce load times and glitches, as well as make it easier to sync with our other tools.
- **Flexible**
-- Sketch has added some great new features that allow symbols to be more flexible. This helps us in reducing the number of symbols we need, as well as allowing us to design for multiple screen sizes with greater ease.
- **Organized**
-- What's the point of using a UI Kit to speed up your design when you spend half your time searching for something? We've made an effort into carefully categorizing and organizing the Sketch symbols for easy reference and use. Please help us maintain this.
