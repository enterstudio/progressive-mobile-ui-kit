# Progressive Mobile UI Kits

The **Progressive Mobile UI Kits** are Sketch files that contain base versions of all our components and best practices. It's a great starting point for beginning the design phase of any of our projects.

The UI Kits are built on the following tenents:

### It's Fast
Many of our tools (including Sketch itself) do not play well with large files. That is why we've made an effort to split out the UI Kit into several files, to reduce load times, glitches, as well as make it easier to sync with our other tools.

### It's Flexible
Sketch has added some great new features that allow symbols to be more flexible. This helps us in reducing the number of symbols we need, as well as allowing us to design for multiple screen sizes with greater ease.

### It's Organized
What's the point of using a UI Kit to speed up your design when you spend half your time searching for the right symbol? We've put a lot of effort into carefully categorizing and organizing the Sketch symbols for easy reference and use.

When using and contributing to the UI Kits, please keep these tenets in mind.

## Getting Started

To start using the kits, just download them! But before you open it, make sure the base fonts are installed, or Sketch will have an conniption.

**Before you begin, you should haveâ€¦**
- The _latest version_ of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono) installed. Both are included in the kit repo.

## Using the Kit

### Setting Up Presets

Once you open the kit, you'll want to start with the **Setup** steps. The Setup steps contain all the type and layer styles used in the components through out. 

By first altering these styles you will have a headstart in matching the components to your customer's brand.

### Using Symbols

The symbols included in the UI Kits are named in line with their code counterparts. This is intended to be a reference for the developers who will inherit the designs; by maintaining this naming scheme, the developers will know which components you've used and what they need to include in their build.

As such, we do not recommend renaming the individual instances of the symbol themselves, as that would remove the reference point. If you want to organize the symbols used in your page, please do so with Groups.

### Sharing with Developers

Once your design is done and approved, you will eventually need to pass them onto your developers. They may not have Sketch, and while you _could_ pass along flats, you'll be losing one of the benefits of using the UI Kit: the reference to the symbols code counterparts.

Even if Sketch is unavailable to your development team, we recommend using another tool to pass the designs along:

- InVision Inspect
- Zeplin
